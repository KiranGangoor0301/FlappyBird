# Flappy Bird Game

## Overview
This project is a simple **Flappy Bird** game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game is implemented using the HTML5 `<canvas>` element to render the game world and animations. The objective of the game is to navigate the bird through gaps in the pipes while avoiding collisions.

## Features
- **Game Loop**: The game continuously updates the bird's position and the movement of the pipes.
- **Jump Mechanism**: The player can make the bird jump by pressing a key (Space, Arrow Up, or X).
- **Randomly Generated Pipes**: Pipes appear at random heights and move across the screen.
- **Collision Detection**: The game detects collisions between the bird and pipes, ending the game if a collision occurs.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases each time the bird successfully passes through a set of pipes.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Open the game in a browser, and it will start automatically.
2. **Control the Bird**: Press the **Space bar**, **Arrow Up**, or **X** key to make the bird jump.
3. **Avoid the Pipes**: The pipes move from right to left, and you must guide the bird through the gaps.
4. **Game Over**: If the bird touches the ground or collides with a pipe, the game ends.
5. **Restart**: Press the **Restart** button after the game ends to start a new game.

## Game Mechanics
- **Gravity**: The bird falls due to gravity, and the player must make the bird jump to avoid the pipes.
- **Pipe Movement**: Pipes move leftward across the screen and reset once they go off-screen.
- **Score**: You earn points every time the bird passes through a pipe set.
- **Highest Score**: The game saves the highest score reached during gameplay.

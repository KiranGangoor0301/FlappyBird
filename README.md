Flappy Bird Game
Overview
This project is a simple Flappy Bird game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is implemented using the HTML5 <canvas> element to render the game world and animations. The objective of the game is to navigate the bird through gaps in the pipes while avoiding collisions.

Features
Game Loop: The game continuously updates the bird's position and the movement of the pipes.
Jump Mechanism: The player can make the bird jump by pressing a key (Space, Arrow Up, or X).
Randomly Generated Pipes: Pipes appear at random heights and move across the screen.
Collision Detection: The game detects collisions between the bird and pipes, ending the game if a collision occurs.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases each time the bird successfully passes through a set of pipes.
How to Play
Start the Game: Open the game in a browser, and it will start automatically.
Control the Bird: Press the Space bar, Arrow Up, or X key to make the bird jump.
Avoid the Pipes: The pipes move from right to left, and you must guide the bird through the gaps.
Game Over: If the bird touches the ground or collides with a pipe, the game ends.
Restart: Press the Restart button after the game ends to start a new game.
Game Mechanics
Gravity: The bird falls due to gravity, and the player must make the bird jump to avoid the pipes.
Pipe Movement: Pipes move leftward across the screen and reset once they go off-screen.
Score: You earn points every time the bird passes through a pipe set.
Highest Score: The game saves the highest score reached during gameplay.
Setup and Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flappy-bird.git
Open the index.html file in a web browser to play the game.

The game is fully functional and doesn't require any external dependencies or setup beyond the browser.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For creating the basic structure of the game.
CSS3: For styling the canvas and game components.
JavaScript: For handling game logic, animations, and user input.
Game Logic Breakdown
Canvas Setup: The HTML5 <canvas> is used to display the game world. The canvas size is dynamically set to match the window size.
Bird Mechanics: The bird is controlled by adjusting its vertical position based on user input and gravity.
Pipe Generation: Pipes are generated at random intervals with random heights, and they move across the screen at a constant speed.
Collision Detection: The game checks if the bird collides with the pipes or the ground. If a collision occurs, the game ends.
Score System: The score is incremented each time the bird successfully passes through a set of pipes.
